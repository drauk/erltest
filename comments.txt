I have already concluded (2018-2-14) that Erlang is not a programming language.
Erlang is a programmable system. It is a kind of virtual universe with virtual
processes which can be programmed.

A real programming language is a language which compiles to assembly language,
which then assembles to machine code. (The assembly language stage is more or
less optional.) Just because Erlang can be compiled to some kind of machine code
does not imply that it is a programming language. In Erlang, you don't program
the CPU to do things. Even in compiled Erlang, your code programs some virtual
processes in a kind of virtual machine. A real programming language, like C or
C++, programs the actions of the CPU.
